        <h2>SolsticeClan Project Information </h2>
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, SASS, Google Sheets, Apps Script<br>
        <p>This project was a collaborative commission for a jcink roleplaying website, Sinister Haven. This project was completed by myself and Jessica Teichman. This project uses google sheets as a database to store character information, which is then displayed on the clan's member page. Site members submit their characters to the spreadsheet through the a form located on the clan page. </p>
    
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an easy to edit database of all characters on the website</li>
            <li>Make adding/editing characters to the clan member's page easier for site staff unfamiliar with coding</li>
            <li>Incorperate statistics about the clan's members onto the page</li>
            <li>Create a system for removing inactive characters from the page, without loosing their descriptions</li>
            <li>Allow site members to add their characters to the clan without having to contact a staff member</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Project Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Character database: character information is stored in google sheets instead of directly in the html</li>
            <li>Character archive: characters can be removed from being displayed on the page, without being deleted to preserve character descriptions. Site members can re-add their characters from the archive onto the clan page without help of a staff member in the archive tab on the clan members page.</li>
            <li>Joining form: site members can add characters to the clan by submitting a form on the clan member's page. Character information is sent directly to the spreadsheet.</li>
            <li>Blood type calculator: each character on the site is assigned a bloodtype when joining based on a random number generator and their parent's bloodtype</li>
            <li>Pending characters: new characters show up as pending until approved by a clan leader</li>
            <li>Character sorting: characters on the member page can be sorted alphabetically, by username, and more</li>
            <li>Character views:site members can view the clan's characters in gallery or allegiences format</li>
            <li>Clan statistics:iframes are used in the clan statistics tab to display clan statistics that will automatically update as characters are added and deleted</li>
            <li>Email notifications:email notifications to clan leaders when there are pending characters waiting for approval on the spreadsheet</li>
        </ul>
